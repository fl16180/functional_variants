# Overview

A large variety of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the genome are associated with specific diseases. Most such genomic variants occur in non-coding DNA sequences and are not directly involved in protein variation. This makes it challenging to understand their function. This project investigates a deep learning approach to predict functional variants using epigenetic markers as predictors. The models outperform previously established benchmarks on the GM12878 lymphoblastoid dataset.
